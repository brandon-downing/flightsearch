Flight Search
============
###This is an example site, using Expedia APIs to deliver flight-search results. 
To start the app, just use *npm start* at the command prompt. 

Locally, the default port is 3000. 

The root  gives you a view that is entierly server-side, in NodeJS via ExpressJS, using Jade for templating. 

The /search context root is an alternative view that uses ReactJS to populate results and details. 

The /find context root is the same as /search, but with a CSS3 flexbox layout.
